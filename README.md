Purpose

The major goal of Soprano is to showcase media streaming on mobile AIR environment, in a real world manner. The project is feature rich and heavily optimized with innovative UI design.

Key feature include:

(1) A fine example of Flash/Flex based media streaming on mobile devices, highlighting OSMF, and delivers features such as live streaming, DVR, ad insertion and analysis

(2) Highly optimized user interface to ensure smooth running even on a single core Android phone (EVO, Nexus S, etc.)

(3) The Slim UI, as a side project, to power the complex experience.
